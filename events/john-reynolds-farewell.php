                  <p>On December 5, 2011, students and colleagues gathered at a  farewell reception in recognition of Dr. John Reynolds as he prepared to  relocate his research group to the Georgia Institute of Technology.&nbsp; Dr. Reynolds first joined the Department of Chemistry at  the University of Florida in 1992, and was most recently the V.T. and Louise  Jackson Professor of Chemistry. He also served as the Associate  Director for the Center for Macromolecular Science and Engineering.&nbsp; His research interests involved electrically  conducting and electroactive conjugated polymers, with work focused on the  development of new polymers by manipulating their fundamental organic structure  in order to control their optoelectronic and redox properties.&nbsp; His group was heavily involved in the areas  developing new polyheterocycles, visible and infrared light electrochromism,  along with light emission from polymer and composite LEDs (both visible and  near-infrared) and light emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).&nbsp; Further work is directed to using organic  polymers and oligomers in photovoltaic cells.&nbsp;  Reynolds obtained his M.S. (1982) and Ph.D. (1984) degrees from the  University of Massachusetts in Polymer Science and Engineering.&nbsp; He will be greatly missed by the Department  and the George and Josephine Butler Polymer Research Laboratory.&nbsp; We wish him continued success in his research  efforts, and are grateful for his 20 years of dedicated scientific leadership.
