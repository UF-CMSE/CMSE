                  <p>Dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride, a nonconjugated diene, was under 
                    study to produce a cross-linked ion exchange resin for the <a href="http://www.onr.navy.mil/" target=_blank>Office of 
                    Naval Research</a>. The research was intended to be rather conventional 
                    chemistry, which in fact sparked observations that defined a concept 
                    involving cyclization during the propagation event. No doubt, and as 
                    expected, the olefin unsaturation in the monomer was completely 
                    consumed during the polymerization; however, no crosslinking was 
                    observed whatsoever. In fact, the polymers were soluble in water!<br>
                    <br>
                    Another pair of monomers, divinyl ether and maleic anhydride also 
                    gave unpredictable results. The experiment that eventually led to 
                    what is known as cyclocopolymerization was done on Thanksgiving Day 
                    in 1951, with no apparent connection to ion exchange resin research. 
                    The goal was to produce a crosslinked medicinal polymer for the 
                    treatment of high blood pressure. The result, instead, was a 
                    completely soluble polymer in basic aqueous solutions - again, an 
                    unbelievable result.<br>
                    <br>
                    These results just were not supposed to be. In 1934 Staudinger 
                    reported that nonconjugated dienes lead to crosslinked polymers 
                    since such monomers are tetrafunctional under radical 
                    polymerizations. Of course, Staudinger is right in most cases, 
                    except when intramolecular reactions prove possible - in this case, 
                    the formation of a ring. In 1937 Flory showed that propagation in 
                    radical polymerization should proceed through the most stable 
                    reactive intermediate (a secondary free radial rather than a primary 
                    free radical in the case of cyclopolymerization chemistry). As a 
                    consequence, the cyclopolymerization of dimethyldiallyl ammonium 
                    chloride (the first monomer to be thoroughly investigated) should 
                    lead to the formation of a six-membered ring. In fact, five-membered 
                    rings are formed for kinetic reasons.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thus was born the concept of intramolecular-intermolecular chain 
                    polymerization, now known everywhere in the world as 
                    cyclopolymerization and cyclocopolymerization.<br>
                    <br>
                    It took several years to work out the mechanistic details, and even 
                    then the scientific community was skeptical of this novel 
                    polymerization scheme. For example, the work was submitted for 
                    presentation before the <a href="http://www.organicdivision.org/" target=_blank>Organic Division of the American Chemical 
                    Society</a> in 1955 but was turned down. In his rejection, the secretary 
                    of the Organic Division offered an alternate explanation of the 
                    observed results (he was wrong, of course). The paper eventually was 
                    accepted for the 1956 ACS meeting and has resulted in more than 
                    4,500 publications in the field from scientists all over the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    The chemistry created about 100 MS and PhD degrees at the University 
                    of Florida and initiated the formation of Peninsular Chemical 
                    Research, a startup company in Gainesville founded by Professor 
                    Butler and Professor Paul Tarrant. The company was immediately 
                    successful and produced commercial products that were sold 
                    everywhere for a variety of applications. First success was found in 
                    potable and wastewater treatment and purification, followed by 
                    applications in the paper and textile industry, the cosmetic and 
                    personal care field, in biological, medical and food applications, 
                    in membrane technology, and in agricultural and soil treatment.<br>
                    <br>
                    The success continues today. Not only does cyclopolymerization 
                    continue to enjoy commercial and academic success, it spawned the 
                    <a href="../index.php">Center for Macromolecular Science &amp; Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu" target=_blank>University of 
                    Florida</a>. We all are grateful for what Professor Butler started 60 
                    years ago.<br>
