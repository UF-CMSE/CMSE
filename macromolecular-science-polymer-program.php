                  Polymer Program and Courses</h1>
                  <p>The Polymer Program within the Center for Macromolecular Science 
                    &amp; Engineering is fully integrated with academic departments on 
                    campus, and as such graduate students receive the benefits derived 
                    from a fundamental educational approach to his or her discipline. We 
                    stress the need to become fully competent in a given field of 
                    science or engineering, including an emphasis on polymer structure 
                    and behavior.<br>
                    <br>
                    <img border="0" src="images/student.jpg" align="right" width="175" height="269">For example, a graduate student interested in the chemical aspects 
                    of macromolecules usually enrolls in the <a href="https://www.chem.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Department of Chemistry</a>. 
                    The prospective student must meet the entrance requirements set for 
                    any Chemistry student, meaning he or she must have the requisite 
                    background to compete in such an environment. The Selection 
                    Committee within the department organizes its work around the 
                    available space within each polymer oriented research group in the 
                    department, then makes its decisions. Entering graduate students 
                    then take the correct coursework needed to qualify in one of the 
                    five divisions within the department (analytical, biochemical, 
                    organic, inorganic, physical), followed by written and oral 
                    qualifying examinations. Graduate courses in polymer chemistry are 
                    included in the student's coursework as well. The graduate student 
                    receives the majority of his or her exposure to the science of 
                    polymers in the research laboratory. Again, the exposure is oriented 
                    towards the chemical aspects of macromolecules with a focus on 
                    mechanism, synthesis, structure proof, and structure behavior 
                    relationships. A study of behavior leads to productive interactions 
                    with engineering faculty on campus. The end result of being exposed 
                    to this environment is the production of a MS or PhD chemist well 
                    versed in the fundamentals of chemistry, who also has a strong 
                    knowledge of polymer science.<br>
                    <br>
                    This macromolecular program operates in the same manner within the 
                    other departments represented by Center faculty members (<a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/">Department 
                      of Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.che.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Department of Chemical Engineering</a>, and the <a href="http://www.mse.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Department 
                        of Materials Science &amp; Engineering</a>). Each student receives his or 
                    her
                    department's degree. The stress is on basics, followed by courses 
                    relevant to polymer science or engineering, and eventual 
                    interdisciplinary activity between departments. Graduate courses can 
                    be taken in various departments to broaden the scholastic exposure 
                    to work in macromolecules.<br>
                    <br>
                    This program's approach to graduate education has led to the Center 
                    enjoying a reputation of producing competent polymer scientists and 
                    engineers who are well founded in the fundamentals of his or her 
                    discipline, who interact in an interdisciplinary across 
                    &quot;traditional&quot; boundaries, and who are aware of the importance of 
                    teamwork among people possessing a variety of educational 
                    backgrounds.
