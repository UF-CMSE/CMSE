            &quot;Multicomponent flows of polymeric materials are encountered 
            frequently in various industrial applications. Due to the complexity 
            of polymer rheology, numerous issues involving such flows remain to 
            be understood. Our efforts in this area focus on investigating 
            various multicomponent flows of polymeric fluids through an 
            interplay between process modeling and experiment. Modeling work is 
            aimed at establishing theoretical bases of various fluid mechanical 
            behaviors observed experimentally.&quot;<br>

            developing variable band gap pi conjugated polymers which may find 
            utility in a variety of optoelectronic devices. Using electron rich 
            and electron rich heterocycles polymerized via various transition 
            metal mediated coupling and electrochemical methods, polymers are 
            designed with controlled HOMO and LUMO energy levels and electronic 
            band gaps. This provides electronic absorption and emission 
            properties controllable from the UV, through the visible, the 
            near-infrared and even longer wavelengths. We seek to optimize the 
            properties of polymers as they may be applied to color changing electrochromics, visible and near-infrared light emission, and 
            flexible organic polymer based solar cells.&quot;<br>

            </b>&quot;Research in our lab is focused on the interaction of light with 
            organic and organometallic materials. We have an interest in a 
            number of optical applications such as light emitting devices (LEDs), 
            fluorescent sensors, solar energy conversion and non-linear optical 
            phenomena. In one specific project we are involved in the chemical 
            synthesis and fundamental study of water soluble conjugated polymers 
            (conjugated polyelectrolytes). These materials find application in a 
            number of areas, including fabrication of fluorescent bio-sensors 
            and nano-structured films for use in organic photovoltaic cells. In 
            another line of investigation, we are studying the optical 
            properties of novel conjugated organometallic oligomers and 
            polymers. Finally, we have a long standing interest in the 
            development of thin film based luminescent oxygen sensor materials 
            which are used by aerodynamic engineers to measure air pressure 
            distributions on wind-tunnel models.&quot;<br>

            crystals, fullerenes, and a number of other systems. We have also 
            contributed to transport and other studies, and have worked on 
            techniques and applications. I am also a member of U12IR at the NSLS, 
            where we use synchrotron <br>
