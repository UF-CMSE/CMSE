                  <p><b>HISTORY </b><br>
                    <b> <img border="0" src="images/p3.jpg" align="right" width="207" height="210"></b>In 1946 Professor George Butler joined the Department of Chemistry 
                    after four years with the <a href="http://www.rohmhaas.com/" target=_blank>Rohm &amp; Haas Company</a>. His research group in 
                    polymer chemistry was among the first in academics, and as interest 
                    in polymers grew, Professor Butler formed the <a href="index.php">Center for 
                    Macromolecular Science &amp; Engineering</a> in 1970 to coordinate polymer 
                    research campus wide. The polymer program at Florida is among the 
                    oldest in the United States. <br>
                    <br>
                    Today the Center is comprised of 19 <a href="faculty.php">faculty</a> along with over 120 students 
                    and staff operating in four departments on campus. A number of our faculty acquired extensive industrial 
                    experience prior to joining the University of Florida.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>THE CENTER'S WORK </b><br>
                    The Center promotes collaboration among faculty in polymer science 
                    and engineering on campus and serves as a conduit between industry, 
                    government and our university. We stress a fundamental approach in 
                    our research while seeking solutions to practical problems. We 
                    pursue excellence in all our endeavors. Our conduct is characterized 
                    by ethics, integrity, and honesty. <br>
                    <br>
                    Our work spans the breadth of the polymer field including synthesis 
                    and mechanism, polymer spectroscopy, surface analysis, polymer 
                    processing, electronic properties, and polymer rheology. Both 
                    specialty and common polymers interest us. We are fully equipped to 
                    conduct research in all of these areas. <br>
                    <br>
                    Faculty in the <a href="http://www.che.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Departments of Chemical Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.che.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Chemistry</a>, 
                    <a href="http://mse.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Materials Science and Engineering</a>, and <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Physics</a> comprise the 
                    membership of the organization. Each faculty member operates 
                    independently of the Center, and students receive degrees directly 
                    from their respective departments. The Center enjoys a reputation of 
                    producing competent polymer scientists and engineers well founded in 
                    the fundamentals of his or her particular discipline.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>EXTERNAL INTERACTIONS </b><br>
                    More than 45 companies - past and present - have been working 
                    partners with us, as has been every major government funding agency, 
                    for we have long recognized the interdependent nature of academia, 
                    industry, and government. Students clearly benefit from such 
                    contact, especially in the later phase of their academic career. We 
                    believe these interactions foster professional and personal 
                    development for all of us. <br>
