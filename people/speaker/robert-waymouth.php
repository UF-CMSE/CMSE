                    Robert Waymouth is the Robert Eckles Swain Professor of Chemistry at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. He received B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Chemistry from Washington and Lee University and his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the Caltech in 1987 with Professor R.H. Grubbs. He was a postdoctoral fellow with the late Professor Piero Pino at the ETH in Zurich in 1987 and joined the faculty at Stanford as an Assistant Professor in 1988. He received the Alan T. Waterman Award from the NSF in 1996, the Cooperative Research Award in Polymer Science in 2009, and EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2012 with Dr. James Hedrick. He has won several university teaching awards, including the Walter J. Gores Award, the Phi Beta Kappa Teaching Award, and is currently a Bass Fellow in Undergraduate Education. His research interests are at the interface of Inorganic, Organic and Polymer Chemistry, in particular the development of new concepts in catalysis for the selective synthesis of both macromolecules and fine chemicals. Particular areas of interest include catalytic polymerization reactions, the development of organocatalytic polymerization strategies, and selective oxidation catalysis.</p>

                    What are the challenges and opportunities for creating sustainable materials for the
                    21st Century?   Can  we keep doing what we have been doing?  What are the scientific
                    opportunities that could spawn the next generation of sustainable materials?

                    This lecture will describe developments of organic catalysts for polymer synthesis.
                    Different classes of organic catalysts will be described and the opportunities provided
                    by the rich diversity of their polymerization behavior.

                    This lecture will describe the diversity of mechanisms exhibited by organic polymerization
                    catalysts and how these insights are enabling for the generation of novel macrmolecular

                    <i>Zwitterionic Ring-Opening Polymerization Reactions: Cyclic Polymers</i><br>
                    Cyclic polymers are simple topological isomers of linear polymers, but their properties
                    remain poorly understood. This lecture will describe Zwitterionic ring-opening
                    polymerization, a synthetic strategy to generate high molecular weight cyclic polymers.

                    Catalysis is an enabling science for generating new macromolecules, but is also critical
                    for generating monomers from readily-available feed stocks. This lecture will describe a
                    variety of catalytic approaches for integrating monomer and polymer synthesis to generate
                    new macromolecules.

                    The high functional group tolerance of organic catalysts allows for the generation
                    of highly functionalized biocompatible and biodegradable oligomers.  This lecture

                    This lecture will describe ideas and projects that didn't work, problems that lie beyond
                    our current knowledge / capabilities, and unrealized opportunities.  Failure is a good
