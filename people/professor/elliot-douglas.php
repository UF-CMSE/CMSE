                  <p align="justify"> Elliot P. Douglas, one of our faculty members 
                    comprising the Center for <a href="../../index.php">Macromolecular Science &amp; 
                    Engineering</a>, is currently serving as the Chair of the 
                    Division of Polymeric Materials: Science and Engineering 
                    of the <a href="https://www.acs.org/" target=_blank>American Chemical Society</a>. The division has a membership 
                    of 6,000, representing professionals from academia and 
                    industry from around the world. As Chair, Douglas has 
                    spearheaded an effort to develop 
                    a new strategic plan for the division. 
                    This strategic plan aims to broaden the technical focus 
                    of the division to emerging areas of polymeric materials 
                    science and engineering, such as biomaterials, electronic 
                    and optical materials, and materials for energy. Other aspects 
                    of the plan call for an enhanced web presence for the division 
                    and outreach to younger members, international members, 
                    and professionals in other disciplines who do not typically 
                    consider themselves materials scientists or chemists.<br>
                    <br>
                    Douglas is currently an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://mse.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Department 
                    of Materials Science and Engineering</a>. Douglas’ involvement 
                    in PMSE began in 2000 when he led the division effort to 
                    transition the preprints from paper to CD. He has served 
                    as Member-at-Large, Secretary, Vice-Chair, and Program Chair 
                    for two national meetings.<br>
                    <br>
                    Douglas’ research efforts within the MacroCenter are focused 
                    in three areas. He is investigating the structure and assembly 
                    of collagen for tissue engineering applications. In collaboration 
                    with CMSE member Laurie Gower he has created the first artificial 
                    bone composites that exactly mimic the nanostructure of 
                    real bone. He is continuing this work by creating collagen 
                    scaffolds with controlled structure to optimize mechanical 
                    properties, as well as investigating the physical chemistry 
                    aspects of collagen assembly. A second area of research 
                    is in the area of epoxies for composite applications. Currently 
                    he is working with faculty in the <a href="http://www.ce.ufl.edu/" target=_blank>Department of Civil and 
                    Coastal Engineering</a> to investigate long-term durability 
                    of composites being used for repair of concrete bridge beams. 
                    He recently received an NSF grant to understand the fundamentals 
                    of adhesion between epoxy and cement. His third research 
                    area is in engineering education. He has conducted research 
                    on critical thinking, showing that standard multiple choice 
                    tests of critical thinking actually measure test-taking 
                    skills more than actual critical thinking. He has recently 
                    received an NSF grant to develop guided inquiry activities 
                    for the Introduction to Materials course. He is also looking 
                    at the application of qualitative research methods for understanding 
                    engineering education.<br>
