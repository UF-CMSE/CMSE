                    Gregory Sotzing received his PhD in Organic 
                    Chemistry in 1997 and is presently a tenured Associate Professor 
                    at the <a href="http://chemistry.uconn.edu/" target=_blank>University of Connecticut in the Department of Chemistry</a> 
                    and <a href="http://polymer.ims.uconn.edu/" target=_blank>Polymer Program at the Institute of Materials Science</a>. 
                    Greg obtained his Bachelors of Science degree at Mary Washington 
                    College, now named <a href="http://www.umw.edu/" target=_blank>Mary Washington University</a>, in Fredericksburg 
                    Virginia where he received one of the ACS POLYED awards for his            research on novel fluorinated polyimides under the advisement 
                    of Professor Roy F. Gratz. At the University of Florida, 
                    Greg carried out his graduate work with <a href="https://ww2.chemistry.gatech.edu/reynolds/node/12" target=_blank>Professor John Reynolds</a> 
                    on the polymerization of oligomers containing 3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene 
                    as a route to energy gap control of conjugated polymers 
                    and use of conjugated polymers in electrochromic devices. 
                    Greg moved on from U.F. for a joint post-doc with Professor 
                    Robert Grubbs and Professor Nathan Lewis at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target=_blank>California 
                    Institute of Technology</a> where he was involved in research 
                    on the use of conductive polymers and composites as detectors 
                    for an electronic nose with application toward explosives 
                    and disease detection.<br>
                    <br>
                    In 1999, Greg established his research program at the University 
                    of Connecticut on optically transparent conductive polymers 
                    involving the use of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene. Shortly after, 
                    this work was funded by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. 
                    and eventually commercialized primarily for use as a hole 
                    injection layer for <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/414441/making-light-bulbs-from-dna" target=_blank>light 
                      emitting diodes</a>. In 2003, he was awarded an NSF CAREER 
                    for work involving low energy gap conjugated polymers and 
                    a means to convert processable precursor polymers in the 
                    solid state into conductive polymers. Activities outside 
                    the University have included, with help from many dear friends, 
                    the establishment of a Science and Technology high school, 
                    the <a href="http://www.putnamscience.org/" target=_blank>Putnam Science Academy (PSA)</a> and the first Science Olympiads 
                    in the state of Connecticut which are now in their second 
                    year running. For the past couple years, Greg has been trying 
                    to convince the state legislature that downtown Hartford 
                    is in dire need of a Science and Technology Charter school 
                    that would give, considering the demographics, underprivileged 
                    minorities a choice in education within the public school 
                    system.<br>
                    <br>
                    Research efforts continue to concentrate on how to make 
                    conductive polymers more processable and to have their preparation 
                    in as few steps as possible while maintaining control of 
                    electrical and optical properties. From these efforts, Greg’s 
                    research group has been able to electrospin polymer with 
                    electrochromic function. Greg anticipates that this could 
                    be used in the future for color changing fabric/wearable 
                    fabric displays. Recently, this research was carried by 
                    NewScientist, National Geographic, Discovery/TLC, NPR and 
                    public television. Greg has had the opportunity to collaborate 
                    around the globe and, recently, received a US-Europe collaborative 
                    NSF grant with Toribio F. Otero working with rapid generation 
                    of conductive polymer nanostructures and study of ion diffusion 
                    within these structures during redox switching. With Toribio 
                    being a world expert in artificial muscles, the hope is 
                    to have conductive polymer fiber muscles that will both 
                    flex and change color upon charge injection/removal. Greg 
                    has had research contracts with Air Products and Chemicals, 
                    Inc., Kraft Foods, Philip Morris USA, Triton Systems, Inc. 
                    (Phase II SBIRs with ONR and Army), Sekisui Integrated Research, 
                    National Science Foundation, ACS, and the National Institutes 
                    of Health.

                    <p> Greg and his wife, Fatma Selampinar, live in Storrs, 
                      Connecticut with their son Michael and newly born daughter 
                      Aisha (Feb. 21, 2007). Greg and Michael enjoy biking, 
                      canoeing, and fishing; however, Michael is bored to tears 
                      listening to his father talk about how canoeing in Connecticut 
                      is nothing compared to Florida!<br>
