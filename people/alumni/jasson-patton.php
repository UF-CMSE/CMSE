                    </table>Dr. Patton joined the <a href="http://www.dow.com/" target=_blank>Dow Chemical Company</a> in 1992 hiring into their Research Assignments Program through Freeport, TX. While working in Texas projects ranging from the development of cross linking agents for polycarbonates for the Polycarbonate Business to the development of improved catalyst systems for the synthesis of alternating ethylene-carbon monoxide polymers for the Polyolefin Business were investigated. Following these assignments a temporary rotation in Midland, MI Core R&D developed into a relocation to a permanent assignment where he continues to work today. During this time in Core R&D Jasson has worked on a range of projects mostly focusing on catalyst development both in the areas of polymerization as well as small molecule synthesis. <br>
                    <br>
                    While Jasson’s research has led to many awards and recognition his most outstanding award was to receive the 2000 Scientists Organization Award of the Dow Chemical Company in recognition for outstanding contribution to the field of olefin polymerization catalysis by the invention of novel single site catalysts. In this work he designed, tested, and scaled-up catalysts for development and implementation in the production of specialty EPDM elastomers and synthetic rubbers with a combined market volume of 500 million pounds/year. This catalyst is still in commercial operation today. <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently Jasson resides in Midland, MI with his wife, Carolina Lopez and his two children Daniella Patton (16) and Tara Patton (15). <br>
                    <br>
